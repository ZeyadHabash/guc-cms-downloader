## Downloading VoDs (Video on Demand)

## Windows Users: Initial Setup (If you want to download VoDs)

Before running the GUI (`cms-downloader-gui.py`), you **must** run the setup script to download and configure `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`:

1. **Run the setup script**:
   ```
   python setup_ytdlp_ffmpeg.py
   ```

## macOS and Linux Users: Initial Setup (If you want to download VoDs)

Before running the GUI (`cms-downloader-gui.py`), you need to install `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` and ensure they are available in your system `PATH`.

### 1. Install `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`

#### **macOS (using Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

#### **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

#### **Linux (Fedora):**

```bash
sudo dnf install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

### 2. Ensure they are in your PATH

You should be able to run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
yt-dlp --version
ffmpeg -version
```

If not, add their install locations to your `PATH`.

After setup is complete, you can run the GUI as normal:

## Running the GUI

To start the graphical user interface, run:

```bash
python cms-downloader-gui.py
```

This will launch the application window. Follow the on-screen instructions to log in and download your course materials.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with missing packages, ensure you have installed all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- For problems related to Python versions, check your Python installation with `python --version`.
- If you see errors related to `customtkinter`, make sure your environment is activated and dependencies are installed.
- **Blank window or content not rendering (macOS, sometimes other platforms):**
  - There is a known bug in the underlying GUI toolkit (tkinter/customtkinter) where sometimes the application window opens blank or does not render its content, especially on macOS. If this happens, simply move or drag the window with your mouse, or click the window's title bar. This will force the content to render and the window to become responsive. This is a platform-level issue and not a bug in this application.
